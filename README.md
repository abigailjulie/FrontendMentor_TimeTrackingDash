## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- Bootstrap Icons

### What I learned

I gained more practice with Bootstrap and using a Json file to dynamically populate a dashboard. 

### Continued development

I would like to practice using Json files more. 

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/overview/#overview) - This helped me create the email input form.
- [MDN JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) - This is the main resource I used to learn.
